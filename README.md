# Jane Street Puzzle Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the **Jane Street Monthly Puzzles**. Each puzzle is tackled with Python, and solutions are organized by month for clarity and consistency.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and month folders i.e. july-2025

Each monthly folder typically includes:

- `[puzzle-name].py` ‚Äì Main solution script
- `[puzzle-name-sim].py` ‚Äì Simulation code that emulates the puzzle situation
- `[puzzle-name-compute].py` - More precise or mathematical computation
- `README.md` ‚Äì (Optional) Explanation of the approach and reasoning
- `inputs.txt` ‚Äì (If applicable) Puzzle-specific input data
- `notes.md` ‚Äì (Optional) Thought process, diagrams, or extra notes

## üß† About the Puzzles

Jane Street publishes a **monthly logic/math/programming challenge** at [puzzles.janestreet.com](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/). The problems range from straightforward to highly complex and often require a mix of:

- Combinatorics
- Graph theory
- Probability
- Optimization
- Algorithm design

Solving them is a great way to sharpen problem-solving and programming skills.

## üöÄ Goals

- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Build a toolkit of general-purpose techniques and helper functions
- Create readable, reproducible solutions
- Explore multiple approaches when time allows

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

These are **my personal solutions**. While I strive for correctness, they may contain bugs or suboptimal logic. Feedback and discussion are always welcome!

## üì¨ Submissions

If you're working on the same puzzles and would like to collaborate or compare strategies, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

**Happy puzzling!** üß©
